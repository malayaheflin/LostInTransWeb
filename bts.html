    <p>While our main theme of miscommunication has remained consistent, our plans
        to create frustration in the participant and our central story has been through
        many iterations.

    <p>Our biggest learning curve was learning how to rewire the phone.
        With lots of guidance from our lab tech Ian, and lots of soldering,
        we were able to create an additional circuit to add inside the phone that reroutes its existing
        input and output.

    <p>As for coding, we relied on Python and the integration of some speech
        recognition and Google Translate APIs. Find our code at our Github
        repo here!
