    <h2>artists' statement</h2>
    <p>"Lost in Translation" is a physical art installation where human participants will enter a "phonebooth"
      and try to help out a "bot" lost and in trouble on the other line. This is a play on the frustrating
      human experience of trying to receive help from corporate AI phone systems, where our exhibition now flips the roles
      between robot and human. We hope to relay the confusion that miscounnication can bring, particularly in the space of
      technology, but also relating to the experiences of immigrants from foreign countries.
      By utilizing speech recognition, language translation, and the words from previous participants, each experience is unique and different from the last.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>tech methodology</h2>
    <p>We utilized Python scripts and the Google Translate API to create the phone's
      functionality. By rewiring and adding our own circuits to an old
      thrifted rotary phone, we are able to reroute the input and output to another source
      to run these scripts live.
